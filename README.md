# Atari Documentation

Various official Atari documentation converted into text files. I've scanned them from the original printouts several years ago and converted them into text to have them searchable.

- TOS 1.4 Release Notes
- Atari STE Developer Information Addendum
- Atari Corporation Atari TT030 Hardware Reference Manual
- THE TT030 COMPANION: DEVELOPER'S NOTES FOR THE ATARI TT030
